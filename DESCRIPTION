Title: R utilities for generating SQL queries from model objects
Description: The sqlscore package provides utilities for generating sql queries
    (particularly CREATE TABLE statements) from R model objects. The most important
    use case is generating SQL to score a model trained via R's formula interface,
    which may use formula operators that need to be translated into SQL expressions.
